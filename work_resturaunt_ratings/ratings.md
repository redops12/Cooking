| Vegetable stir fry chicken bowl | 2     | Actually awful flavors, soggy and the sauce tasted garbage          |
| The wellington                  | 7     | Pretty solid, bit mushroomy which got soggy but it's ok             |
| Shakshuka                       | 8     | Really solid option, flavor was good, retained heat and stayed warm |
| Spanish Burrito                 | 6     | Cold eggs are kind mid, so this doesn't go all that hard            |
