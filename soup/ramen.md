# Mistakes

    Not enough flavor on mushrooms
    Not enough flavor in salad
    needs creaminess in the broth

# Best plan

    Homemade broth from chicken or pork bones
    Blanched greens or sprouts
    sauteed mushrooms with salt, butter, garlic
    soft boiled eggs with soy sauce in them
    good meat cooked in salt and lots of flavor
