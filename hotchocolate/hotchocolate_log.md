Problems:

Changes for next time:

## January 19, 2024

Ingredients:

- 1 scoop cocoa powder
- 4 sugar packets
- 1 dash of salt
- 1 splash of vanilla
- 3/4 of mug of fat free milk
- cinnamon on top

Flow:

- 1 min microwave
- Steam
- Mix in most ingredients to liquid, make sure to get edges
- add froth

Review:

- Was a quality flavor but lacked depth and richness

Changes:

- Fattier milk
- more vanilla
- more salt
- steam milk from the bottom to heat then when it's hot froth

## January 22, 2024

Ingredients:

- Whole milk
- 2 scoops honey
- 1 scoop cocoa powder
- small pour of vanilla
- good dash of salt
- cinnamon on top

Flow:

- Steam milk from bottom till it feels hot then froth

Review:

- Quality depth of flavor but lacked sweetness. The honey also was clumped to
the cocoa powder at the bottom

Changes:

- probably switch back to sugar
- for even more depth maybe bring in some extract
- We could also stand for more cocoa perhaps even cacao

## January 23, 2024

Ingredients:

- Whole milk
- 4 packets sugar
- 1 scoop cocoa powder
- good bit of vanilla
- cinnamon on top
- caramel on top

Flow:

- poured flavor ingredients into mug then steamed then mixed then put on
toppings

Review:

- Not my best work, forgot the salt, poured too much milk at the start, and
couldn't froth. It also distincly lacks chocolate flavor.

Changes:

- 2 scoops of cocoa
- less milk
- add salt
- Maybe only use 1% milk whole milk can be a lot, but it is also really creamy
which is great

## January 24, 2024

Ingredients:

- 1% milk
- 4 packets sugar
- Good dash of salt
- 1.5 scoops cocoa powder
- good splash of vanilla, it will look like a bit too much
- Cinnamon on top
- caramel on top

Flow:

- Poured ingredients into mug, steamed milk till outside felt very warm almost
hot, frothed, mixed with ingredients, poured froth on top, added cinnamon and
caramel

Review:

- Pretty quality, I would consider a couple of the sips something I would order
and feel good for ordering. It was a little cold tho, and also lacked some
sugariness.
- The richness was also more acceptable so I think I'll stick to 1% or 2% milk
instead of whole milk.

Changes:

- Might have to go back to microwaving milk to heat it up. Additional factor is
the amount of built up steam in the steamer.
- Might go up to 5 packets of sugar, or I could bring in my own sugar which
would
also be reasonable.
- Should probably also get a box or something to transport all theses
ingredients.

caramel next time, had good depth of flavor.

### Flow

### Review

This one was really good as well. It had a much more milky flavor from the
reduced flavorings but in a good way where all the flavors were more present.
I think I still want it to have a bit more interesting flavor, maybe a bit
more nuttiness and that could come from Cacao. It could also come from a nut
extract, so we'll add that to list of things to try.

### Changes

- Basically perfect. Everything past this is going to be experimenting with
different recipes.
