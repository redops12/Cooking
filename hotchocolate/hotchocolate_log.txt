Whole milk
2 scoops honey
1 scoop cocoa powder
small pour of vanilla
good dash of salt
cinnaomn on top

Flow:
Steam milk from bottom till it feels hot then froth

Quality depth of flavor but lacked sweetness. The honey also was clumped to the cocoa powder at the bottom

for even more depth maybe bring in some extract
We could also stand for more cocoa perhaps even cacao

Ingredients:
Whole milk
4 packets sugar
1 scoop cocoa powder
good bit of vanilla
cinnamon on top
caramel on top

Flow:
poured flavor ingredients into mug then steamed then mixed then put on toppings

Review:
Not my best work, forgot the salt, poured too much milk at the start, and couldn't froth. It also distincly lacks chocolate flavor.

Changes:
2 scoops of cocoa
less milk
add salt
Maybe only use 1% milk whole milk can be a lot, but it is also really creamy which is great

================================================================================
Ingredients:
1% milk
4 packets sugar
Good dash of salt
1.5 scoops cocoa powder
good splash of vanilla, it will look like a bit too much
Cinnamon on top
caramel on top

Flow:
Poured ingredients into mug, steamed milk till outside felt very warm almost hot, frothed, mixed with ingredients, poured froth on top, added cinnamon and caramel

Review:
Pretty quality, I would consider a couple of the sips something I would order and feel good for ordering. It was a little cold tho, and also lacked some sugariness.
The richness was also more acceptable so I think I'll stick to 1% or 2% milk instead of whole milk.

Changes:
Might have to go back to microwaving milk to heat it up. Additional factor is the amount of built up steam in the steamer.
Might go up to 5 packets of sugar, or I could bring in my own sugar which would also be reasonable.
Should probably also get a box or something to transport all theses ingredients.

Changes:
Warm up milk at start. Add more flavor somehow
